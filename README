To build:

mvn install -Dbuild.jdk.home=<build time home of a 1.4 jdk>\
     [-Dbuild.jre.home=<runtime home of a 1.4 jdk] assembly:attached

build.jdk.home defaults to $JAVA_HOME as does build.jre.home but this
may result in compile errors so best to set it.

Also you can set

-Dbuild.opennmsd.home to the place opennmsd will live at runtime.
 This defaults to /opt/OV/opennmsd

-Dbuild.opennmsd.log to the place you want the log file to be written
 to.  This defaults to /var/opt/OV/share/log.  

if the runtime java binary is not in ${build.jre.home}/bin/java then
you may set its value using ${build.jre.bin}
