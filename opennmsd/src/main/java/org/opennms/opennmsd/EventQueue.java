/**
 * An EventQueue that handles the differentiation between preserved and only accepted events.

 * in m_preservedQueue. Then any events that exist are in m_queue.
 * 
 * State transition:
 * 
 * Forwarding: 
 *  getEventsToForward() returns a batch of up to maxBatch events from queue
 *  
 *  addEventToPerservedQ:
 *    if (not max'd) add it

 *    if (max'd) clear nextBatch, clear queue then add it
 *  
 *  // this state should imply that one of nextBatch and preserveQ is not empty
 *  remove all queue events and put pending ones into preserveQ list
 *  
 *  if nextBatch is not filled to maxBatchSize events then add as many events as are available
 *  from the preserveQ to nextBatch
